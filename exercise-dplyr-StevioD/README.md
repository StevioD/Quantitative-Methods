# `dplyr` During & After Class

This code accompanies and follows up on the class on `dplyr`. Included in this repo are the following
items: 

* `dplyr_tutorial_pt1.Rmd`: This is an introduction to the main "verbs" of `dplyr`. If you can, 
work through this code between watching the lecture on `dplyr` and the subsequent class period.
* `dplyr_tutorial_pt2.Rmd`: This code adds a few sections onto part 1. 
We'll work through this code in class, though feel free to step through it beforehand.
