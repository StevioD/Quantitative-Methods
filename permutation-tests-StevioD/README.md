# Satisfaction Permutation Tests

In week 1 we discussed analysis of an employee satisfaction survey. Since the survey was a census, 
normal statistical approaches (like a t-test) do not apply. This assignment asks you to 
extend the work with a few more tests. The R-Markdown file has code blocks for you to edit and 
questions for you to answer.
