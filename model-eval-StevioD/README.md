# Model Evaluation Assignment

This assignment asks you to continue the work we did in class, evaluating the five 
models of subaru price. The data you should use to evaluate the model is in the
file `price_estimates.txt`, which holds estimated prices for all data in the test
data set. 

Your goal is to evaluate the models and understand their performance a bit. Specifically,

* Compare the models with some of our measures of accuracy. Does one model stand out?
* In the above, use one measure of accuracy that is not `rmse`, `rsq`, `mae`, or `mape` and 
  give a brief description of what it is. 
  
* What would you consider the two best models? 

* For the best and second-best models, are there certain parts of the data space 
  where they seem to do worse? This doesn't need to be a super deep dive, but 
  consider their performance on 
    * Cars of different models
    * Cars of different ages
    * Cars of different mileages

Submit an R-Markdown file and the knitted HTML. You'll start from scratch on this RMD but feel 
free to use a recent assignment as a template. As always, **pay attention to the formatting of your output!**

I've included the models evaluated against the _training_ data
set in a file called `training_price_estimates.txt`; this file may be useful for diagnostics.
