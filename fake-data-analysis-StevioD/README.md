# Analyzing Synthetic Data

This assignment asks you build a regression model and interpret it. 

## Selecting the Data

We'll assign data sets in class 
using [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DuInbRRUvaKacpNAK9Qrm0RCEatd_z9Ve4n8RB5Vsh8/edit?usp=sharing). 
The data files and the descriptive statistics are available on Moodle. If you weren't able to 
attend class live, choose a data set for yourself on the spreadsheet, making sure that all 
data sets have `n` analyzers before moving on to `n+1`. 

## Analysis

Your goal is to build a regression model with your assigned data. You don't have to do 
our customary exploratory data analysis (EDA), since your classmate has done that for you. 

Build the model that you think makes the most sense and interpret it. Build a new, well-formatted RMD
file with your analysis and results. Knit this to HTML and, as usual, submit both your RMD and your HTML.

Once again, to keep things a bit snappier, your first draft needs to be turned in within
one week. We're getting the assignment on March 1, so please commit and push your 
assignment by March 8.
